 <span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Terms of Service</span>

PLEASE READ THESE **TERMS OF SERVICE** CAREFULLY. THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THEY INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (UNLESS YOU OPT OUT). THESE TERMS ALSO INCLUDE A PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF FOR ALL MATTERS IN EITHER COURT OR ARBITRATION, VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND GOVERNING LAW OF DISPUTES, EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Introduction</span>

**Rentos** (“**Rentos**”, “we”, or “us”), provides an online car-sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with travelers and locals seeking to book those vehicles. Rentos is accessible online as an application for mobile devices. The Rentos website, mobile applications, and associated services are collectively referred to as “the Services.” By accessing or using the Services, including by communicating with us or other Rentos users, you agree to comply with, and be legally bound by, the provisions of these **Terms of Service** (these “**Terms**”), whether or not you become a registered user of the Services. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Rentos.

These Terms, together with the cancellation policy, privacy policy, applicable insurance terms and certificates, billing and refund policies, community guidelines, roadside assistance terms, and the additional policies (together, the “Policies”) constitute the “Agreement” between you and Rentos (each a “Party” and together, “the Parties”). In addition, Rentos provides a **Car Sharing Agreement** that summarizes the terms of each reservation, accessible in the Services for any booked or previous trips, and you may use it as proof of a reservation.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Modification</span>
 

**Rentos** reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify the Services or to modify the Agreement, including these Terms, at any time. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Services. We will also update the “Last Revised” date of these Terms. If you continue to access or use the Services after we have posted a modification or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified terms. If the modified terms are not acceptable to you, your sole recourse is to stop using and accessing the Services and close your Rentos Account within 30 days. If you choose to close your Rentos Account, the previous effective version of these Terms will apply to you, unless you use the Services during the intervening 30-day period, in which case the new version of these Terms will apply to you.


<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Eligibility</span>

The Services are intended solely for guests who meet our eligibility requirements in the location where the vehicle is booked and hosts are 18 or older and able to list eligible vehicles. Any use of the Services by anyone that does not meet these eligibility requirements is expressly prohibited.


<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Registration</span>
 

To access certain features of the Services, you must sign up for an account with us (a “**Rentos Account**”). You can create a Rentos Account by providing us your first and last name, email address, mobile phone number, and creating a password or connecting through an account with a third-party site or service (including Google). When you book a vehicle as a traveler or guest (“guest”), you provide us with certain additional information about yourself. Similarly, when you list a vehicle as a vehicle owner or host (“host”), you provide us with certain additional information about yourself and your vehicle(s) (if applicable). You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration, booking, and/or listing process. You must keep your Rentos Account up to date at all times. Based on information you provide, Rentos may impose additional requirements for you to book a trip (e.g., providing a deposit, adding a second form of payment, buying a certain level of protection plan, or other requirements).

 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Verification</span>
 

Where permitted, Rentos has the right, but not the obligation, to undertake screenings, checks, and engage in processes designed to (1) help verify the identities or check the backgrounds of users, including driving history and driver’s license validity and (2) verify vehicle details. Rentos does not endorse any vehicle, user, or a user’s background, or commit to undertake any specific screening process. Rentos may in its sole discretion use third-party services to verify the information you provide to us and to obtain additional related information and corrections where applicable, and you hereby authorize Rentos to request, receive, use, and store such information. Rentos may permit or refuse your request to book or list a vehicle in its sole and absolute discretion. Rentos may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles shared through the Services. We do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse the safety, roadworthiness, or legal status of any vehicles shared via the Services. Rather, hosts have sole responsibility to ensure their vehicles are in safe and operable condition, legally registered to be driven on public roads, have a clean title (e.g., non-salvaged/non-branded/non-washed/non-written off), not subject to any applicable safety recalls, and otherwise satisfy our vehicle eligibility requirements.

 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Consumer Report Authorization</span>

When you attempt to book or list a vehicle, or at any time after where Rentos reasonably believes there may be an increased level of risk associated with your Rentos Account, you hereby provide Rentos with written instructions and authorize Rentos, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, applicable consumer reporting laws, or any similar laws to obtain your personal and/or business auto insurance score, credit report, and/or conduct a background check, including a criminal background check where permissible under applicable law.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Fees</span>
 

The fees we charge for using the Services and other cost structures will be itemized at checkout for guests. You can verify the amount for your trip at checkout before you submit your trip request. When you provide Rentos a payment method, you authorize Rentos, or third-party service providers acting on behalf of Rentos, to store your payment credential for future use in the event you owe Rentos any money. You authorize Rentos to use stored payment credentials for balances, including for Trip costs, host fees, and guest fees (e.g., late fees, security deposits, processing fees and claims costs, and related administrative fees). In some cases, our payment processors have arrangements with card networks to automatically update stored payment credentials whenever you receive a new card (e.g., replacing an expired card or one that was reported lost or stolen) and we will rely on such updates to stored payment credentials for balances. If we attempt to issue a refund and the original payment method is no longer on file or otherwise inaccessible, we reserve the right to issue travel credit in lieu of refunding to your original payment method. Any use of referral travel credit is governed by the terms and conditions outlined here.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Collection of Fees</span>
 

Rentos and its service providers will employ all legal methods available to collect amounts due, including the engagement of collection agencies or legal counsel. Rentos, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your Rentos Account to credit bureaus. As a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Rentos Account may be reflected in your credit report. In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts or chargebacks will be charged with fees and/or charges that are incidental to the collection of delinquent accounts or chargebacks including, but not limited to, collection fees, convenience fees, and/or other third-party charges. If you wish to dispute the information Rentos reported to a credit bureau, please contact us. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your Rentos Account, you must contact the collection agency directly.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Taxes</span>
 

In certain jurisdictions, Rentos may enable the collection and remittance of certain taxes from or on behalf of guests or hosts (including, if applicable, Co-hosts), based on existing and future tax regulations, including marketplace facilitator or car sharing regulations. The amount of taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Rentos will be visible to, and separately stated, to both guests and hosts (including, if applicable Co-hosts) on their respective trip-related documents and invoices. Where Rentos is facilitating the collection and remittance of taxes, hosts are not permitted to collect the same taxes on the Services in relation to their vehicle sharing in that jurisdiction.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Your Commitments</span>
 

You agree that you will always use your **Rentos Account** and the Services in compliance with these Terms, applicable law, and any other policies and standards provided to you by Rentos.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Account Activity</span>
 

You are, and will be solely responsible for, all activity that occurs through your **Rentos Account**. Keep your **Rentos Account** information, including your password, secure. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your **Rentos Account**, whether you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Rentos of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your **Rentos Account**. We are not responsible for your failure to comply with this clause, or for any delay in shutting down or protecting your **Rentos Account** unless you have reported unauthorized access to us.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Content</span>
 

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Rentos Content and User Content License</span>
 
Subject to your compliance with the provisions of these Terms, **Rentos** grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, to access and view any **Rentos** and/or user content to which you are permitted access, solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes. You have no right to sublicense the license rights granted in this section. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by **Rentos** or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">User Content</span>
 

We may, in our sole discretion, permit you to post, upload, publish, submit or transmit content through the Services such as photographs of you and your vehicle(s), reviews, feedback, and descriptions of you, your vehicle, or trip. By making available any content on or through the Services, or through **Rentos** promotional campaigns, you grant **Rentos** a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual (or for the term of the protection), non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, view, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, access, view, and otherwise exploit such content on, through, by means of, or to promote or market the Services. Except as described above with respect to **Rentos** photography provided to hosts, **Rentos** does not claim any ownership rights in any such content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit any such content.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Copyright Protection</span>
 
We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate **Rentos Accounts** of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the Lebanese Law on the Protection of Literary and Artistic Property (No. 75 of April 3, 1999) and similar laws. If you think a user is violating your copyright(s) and want to notify us, please contact us via email or through the website.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Google Terms</span>
 

Some areas of the Services implement Google Maps/Places mapping services, including Google Places API. By using the Services, you are bound by Google's Terms of Service.

<span style="font-size: 36px; color: black;">Other Legal Matters</span>
 

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Violations</span>

Rentos has the right, but not the obligation, to investigate, pursue, and seek to prosecute, litigate, or refer to law enforcement, violations of the Agreement to the fullest extent permissible by the law.

Rentos reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, in accordance with applicable law, to remove or disable access to any content that Rentos, at its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms, or otherwise harmful to the Services or our community. If we believe you are abusing Rentos, our users, or any other person in any way or violating the letter or spirit of any of these Terms, we may, in our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your **Rentos Account** and access to the Services, remove hosted content, deny a damage claim, remove or demote your listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using the Services. If your listings are priced artificially high compared to similar vehicles in the market area and/or priced unreasonably, we reserve the right to restrict the listing or remove you from the Services. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse or terminate access to the Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion to the full extent permitted under applicable law.

 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Policy Enforcement</span>

When an issue arises, we may consider the user’s performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our Policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing, subject to our sole and absolute discretion.

 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Communications with You</span>

You agree that Rentos may contact you by electronic means (e.g., electronic mail; notifications via Rentos messaging; app notification) in lieu of any requirement for mailed notices. To contact you more efficiently, you agree that we may at times also contact you using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages at your phone number(s). We will not place such calls for marketing purposes. Rather, we may only place such calls or texts to confirm your signup, provide notices regarding your **Rentos Account** or **Rentos Account** activity, investigate or prevent fraud, collect a debt owed to us or recover unpaid invoices, or communicate urgent messages. We may share your phone number(s) with service providers with whom we contract to assist us in pursuing these interests. We will not share your phone number(s) with third parties for their own purposes without your consent. Standard telephone minute and text and data charges may apply. Where Rentos is required to obtain your consent for such communications, you may choose to revoke your consent. You agree that Rentos may contact you on any day, at any time of day, and in relation with the above purposes.

You authorize Rentos and our service providers, without further notice, to monitor or record telephone conversations or web chat interactions you have, or anyone acting on your behalf has, with Rentos or its agents for quality control, training, or other purposes. You understand and agree that your communications with Rentos may be overheard, monitored, or recorded. If you do not wish to have your call recorded, please contact us instead in writing through email or through Rentos messaging. If you do not wish to have your chat activity recorded or monitored, please do not use the chat function on the Services.

 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Insurance and Protection Plans</span>

Rentos is not an insurance company and does not insure hosts or guests. Host and guest protection plans made available through the Services are in no way related. To be eligible for the benefits of a protection plan, hosts and guests must comply with these Terms. Please refer to the specific terms for guests and specific terms for hosts sections below for additional information based on the nature of your use of the Services.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Specific Terms for Guests</span> 
 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Guest Commitments</span> 

As a guest, you commit that you will be a legally licensed driver and provide proof to the host or via the Services of a current, valid driver’s license. You will treat the vehicle and any applicable Extras well and will take all reasonable measures to return the vehicle and any applicable Extras on time and in essentially the same condition as received. You will not allow anyone other than a person listed in the trip details as an Approved Driver to drive the vehicle you booked.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">No Right of Withdrawal</span> 

The parties acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, once these Services are executed by all parties, it shall constitute a binding and enforceable contract. The rights, obligations, and commitments outlined herein are final, and no party shall have the right to unilaterally withdraw, cancel, or revoke this Agreement, except as expressly permitted by the terms of these Services or as required by law. However, guests have the right to modify any protection plan selected for a trip prior to the start of the reservation.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Guest Financial Responsibility for Physical Damage to the Vehicle</span> 

The guest that booked the trip (“**primary guest**”) is financially responsible for all physical damage to or theft of a booked vehicle that occurs during a trip, plus any additional costs and fees resulting from damage of any kind to the vehicle, regardless of who is found to be at fault. This responsibility applies whether the primary guest has their own auto insurance or not.

Primary guests may be insured against damage to the booked vehicle under their own automobile policies. When you book a vehicle on Rentos, you agree that if any damage occurs to the booked vehicle during the booked trip, you will work with Rentos to make a claim for coverage under any policy of insurance that applies to the loss.

The primary guest can limit the amount they are obligated to pay out of their own pocket in the event there is damage to the booked vehicle during the booked trip by choosing a protection plan on the Services. The limitation on the amount a primary guest may have to pay out of pocket included in any protection plan only applies (1) if the primary guest and any Approved Driver abide by these Terms and (2) to physical damage that is not mechanical or interior damage. The primary guest may change the protection plan selected by navigating to 'modify trip' in any reservation that has not started.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Auto Liability Insurance and Legal Liability Protection</span> 

Hosts offering a vehicle for sharing on the Services cannot offer you liability insurance. If the guest has their own personal auto policy, it will be primary over the auto liability insurance or protection provided with each trip, depending on various factors such as applicable laws, where the guest books the vehicle, and/or where the accident or damages occur. If the guest is using the vehicle for professional use, the auto liability insurance or protection provided with each trip will be excess to any other personal or commercial policy.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Use of the Vehicle</span> 

When you book a vehicle on the Services, you must use the vehicle only for your personal or professional use and not for any commercial purposes unless you have written permission from the Rentos Legal Department in advance. You may not access a vehicle until the trip start time and you must return the vehicle on time and to the correct location. You must present the host with a current, valid driver’s license. You must exercise reasonable care in your use of the vehicle. You are always required to operate the vehicle safely, and in compliance with all applicable laws (e.g., speed limits and prohibitions on impaired or distracted driving, etc.). In the event Rentos has any concern about your use of a vehicle, Rentos holds all rights to terminate your trip in its discretion at any time and require the return of the vehicle, including recovering the vehicle on behalf of the host. You, and all passengers, are required to wear seat belts during the operation of the vehicle. You are required to meet any laws or regulations concerning child safety seats and other protections for children. You must not leave the car unlocked or with the keys unsecure (such as in the ignition). You must not engage in any prohibited uses with any vehicle you book through the Services. If you have any concerns about your planned use, please contact Rentos via email or through the app chat feature. If you misuse a vehicle, you will be fully financially responsible for any related claims, loss, or damage, and your protection plan may be voided. Guests also acknowledge that using a vehicle in a prohibited manner or otherwise breaching the Agreement may lower available liability coverage to legal minimum limits, or nullify coverage, and may furthermore nullify any comprehensive or collision protection and/or protection plan where allowed by applicable law.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Telematics Notice and Release</span> 

Vehicles booked on Rentos may have features or an on-board device that may monitor the state of the vehicle at all times, during a trip. Non-personal information collected by the features or on-board device may include, for example, a vehicle’s condition; damage and accident records; performance, operation, and diagnostic data; and information on mileage, acceleration, velocity, fuel consumption, fuel level, tire pressure, odometer, location and direction, and other vehicle information (“Vehicle Data”). Use of the features or on-board device is subject to the terms and conditions posted by the vehicle manufacturer or technology provider, which may include system and service limitations, warranty exclusions, limitations of liability, wireless service provider terms, privacy practices, descriptions of use and sharing of information, and user responsibilities. Unless prohibited by law, you authorize the use or disclosure of or access to the Vehicle Data and you shall inform any Approved Driver and passengers of the terms of this section. You release the host and agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless host, operator of the features or on-board devices, wireless carrier(s) and other suppliers of components or services and their respective employees, officers, directors and agents from any damage (including incidental and/or consequential damages) to persons (including without limitation you, an Approved Driver, and passengers) or property caused by failure of the features or on-board device to operate properly or otherwise arising from the use of the feature or on-board device by you, an Approved Driver, or passengers.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Condition of the Vehicle and Optional Extras</span> 

You understand that third parties own the vehicles and Extras offered through the Services. Each host is responsible for complying with all legal requirements (including ensuring the vehicle is registered and insured) and maintaining their vehicle(s) in safe and roadworthy condition. Please complete a visual inspection before you begin your use of the vehicle. If you find damage in your initial inspection, you should upload photos of such pre-existing damage at the start of your reservation to ensure you are not held responsible for pre-existing damage. If you find damage on your initial inspection and fail to report it, Rentos, third-party administrators, or insurance partners, may assume that the damage occurred during your reservation period. If, after your initial inspection, you believe that the vehicle is not safe to drive, please do not use the vehicle; instead, contact the Rentos team immediately.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">No Responsibility for Shared Vehicles or Personal Belongings</span> 

You acknowledge that Rentos is not responsible and shall not be liable for the safety, roadworthiness, or legal status (e.g., whether the vehicle is legally registered or the subject of a stolen vehicle report) of any vehicles shared via the Services. Rather, hosts have sole responsibility to ensure their vehicles are in safe and operable condition, legally registered to be driven on public roads, not subject to a missing or stolen vehicle report, have a clean title (e.g., non-salvaged/non-branded/non-washed/non-written off), not subject to any applicable safety recalls, and otherwise satisfy our vehicle eligibility requirements. You also acknowledge and agree that neither Rentos nor hosts are responsible for lost or stolen property left in any vehicle or taken or damaged during a trip.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Incident Reporting</span> 

Where you elected for a protection plan when booking your trip via the Services, you must immediately report any damage to the vehicle you are using to Rentos. You will need to use all reasonable efforts to secure evidence from any available witnesses and to provide Rentos or third-party claims administrators with a written description of the incident and any other information requested, including identity and insurance information of any parties involved in the incident. You are also required to cooperate in any loss investigation conducted by Rentos, third party claims administrators, or insurers. After an incident involving anything more than minor vehicle damage (e.g., small dent or scratch), you may not continue to use the vehicle unless you have the explicit permission of Rentos staff. Failure to timely report an incident or cooperate in an investigation may reduce or invalidate any protection plan received via the Services.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Vehicle Theft</span> 

The following conduct may result in the reporting of the vehicle you have booked as stolen to law enforcement, possibly subjecting you and any other driver to arrest, and civil and/or criminal penalties, and the voiding of your protection plan:
- If you fail to return the vehicle you booked at the time and place agreed upon with the host and/or designated in your reservation
- If you do not return the vehicle by the end of the reservation period and you have not properly obtained an extension of the reservation through the Services
- If the vehicle is returned to any place other than the return location on the reservation or agreed upon with the host. Any damage to, or loss or theft of, a vehicle occurring prior to the host inspecting the vehicle upon return at the end of the reservation is the guest’s responsibility
- If you misrepresent facts to the host pertaining to booking, use, or operation of vehicle
- If the vehicle’s interior components and mandatory safety equipment, or the vehicle itself, are stolen or damaged when the vehicle is left unlocked or running or unattended with the keys not secured during reservation period
- If you fail or refuse to communicate in good faith with the host, police, Rentos, or other authorities with a full report of any accident or vandalism involving the vehicle or otherwise fail to cooperate in the investigation of any accident or vandalism
- If the vehicle is operated by anyone who has given a fictitious name, false address, or a false or invalid driver’s license, whose driver’s license becomes invalid during the reservation period, who has obtained the keys without permission of the host, or who misrepresents or withholds facts to/from the host or Rentos material to the booking, use, or operation of vehicle

The primary guest who books the reservation is responsible for any private investigation costs Rentos deems necessary to recover a vehicle that is not returned. In addition, a **$500 case administration fee** will be imposed on the primary guest if Rentos and/or the host has to report a vehicle as stolen to law enforcement due to it not being returned.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Repossession</span> 

Rentos, a hired agent of Rentos, or the host may repossess any vehicle booked through the Services without demand, at the guest’s expense, if the vehicle is not returned by the end of the reservation, is found illegally parked, apparently abandoned, or used in violation of applicable law or these Terms.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Missing Vehicles</span> 

If a vehicle you have booked through the Services goes missing and/or is stolen during the reservation period (or extension period), you must immediately return the original ignition key to the host, file a police report immediately after discovering the vehicle is missing or stolen, but in no event more than **12 hours** after discovering it has gone missing, and cooperate fully with the host, law enforcement, Rentos, and other authorities in all matters related to the investigation.

 
<span style="font-size: 36px; color: black;">Specific Terms for Hosts</span> 
 
<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Host commitments</span>

As a host, you commit that you will provide a safe and legally registered and insured vehicle, with current license plates, with a clean (non-salvage/branded/written off) title, and in good mechanical condition. You will provide such vehicle on time but only to a guest who is listed on the Services as an Approved Driver for the trip. Other than what is required for you to verify a guest’s driver’s license, you will not collect any information or documentation from your guest at check-in, including guest personal auto insurance. You agree not to use any guest information made available to you by using the Services to collect additional personal data about guest(s), including but not limited to conducting background checks. You commit that your listings will be complete and accurate and you will honor all representations made in your listings, including honoring the price quoted to a guest. In the event of a vehicle swap, you will not require a guest to accept a higher priced vehicle or force an unwanted vehicle upgrade. You will not cancel a booking for the purpose of seeking a higher price from a guest. You will not offer any vehicle or optional Extra that you do not yourself own or have authority to share or that may not be shared for compensation pursuant to the terms and conditions of any agreement with a third party, including, but not limited to, a lease or financing agreement. If your vehicle is subject to a lease, loan, or other financing agreement, you must confirm sharing your vehicle on Rentos does not violate the terms of the contract with the lienholder. You will not offer any Extra that is not safe, clean, and acceptable for the use it is intended. You will not offer any vehicle that is the subject of a missing or stolen vehicle report. You will not offer any vehicle that is the subject of a safety recall without first properly addressing the matter subject to the recall. You will not offer a vehicle that is not roadworthy (i.e., not “street legal”) in the location where it is shared, and it will not have any illegal modifications to any part of the vehicle. You will remove any firearms or other weapons from your vehicle prior to providing it to a guest. You will repay loans related to your Rentos business on time and in full. When you direct Rentos to retrieve your account information from third parties, including but not limited to toll agencies, you grant Rentos a limited power of attorney to access the third-party services to retrieve such account information; Rentos will be acting as your agent and will not be acting on behalf of the third party.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Vehicle information given at listing; listing conditions</span> 

When you sign up for Rentos, you will identify passenger vehicle(s) that you want to list for sharing through the Services. Each vehicle must meet the necessary requirements (e.g., vehicle age, maintenance, working odometer, title status, vehicle value, policy adherence, insurance requirements, etc.). You may only use the Services in connection with vehicles that you own or otherwise have all the necessary rights and permissions to share for compensation. If the vehicle you list on the Services is enabled with a device or OEM technology capable of determining the location of the vehicle, collecting telematics data, disabling technology, or image capturing you agree to comply with the requirements for tracking and technology devices and applicable law.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Listing only on the Services</span> 

Any vehicle you list on the Services must be exclusively listed on the Services. You cannot list any vehicles you intend to share on the Services on any other car sharing marketplace. Failure to abide by this condition may result in fines, penalties, denial of physical damage claims, removal of the vehicle from the Services, account closure, or other action, in Rentos' sole discretion.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Vehicle availability</span> 

Once a trip is booked, you must make the vehicle available or deliver the vehicle as expected by the guest. If you offer the guest the option to pick up your vehicle at a persistent specified location, you must supply the location of the vehicle accurately to Rentos and ensure that the vehicle is available at that location at the beginning of the reservation period.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">License confirmation</span> 

In order to qualify for available protection plans, you must verify that a prospective guest has a current, valid driver’s license before you provide the guest your vehicle, and ensure the driver’s license matches the name on the reservation and that the person picking up the vehicle appears to match the photograph on a facially valid driver’s license.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Pricing, earnings, and payments</span> 

You will not have the ability to set, revise, or edit the vehicle’s pricing. Rentos will pay you the amount collected from guests that book your vehicle, less the applicable fees payable to Rentos. To the extent you owe Rentos or any third party lender money for any reason, Rentos also reserves the right to deduct those amounts from your earnings payment, debit your bank account, charge any of your payment methods on file, and/or send you an invoice.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Maintenance</span> 

You are required to regularly check your vehicle for any defects in its operations or safety. You vow that, at all times, your vehicle will be in safe and roadworthy condition, in good mechanical condition, and in full compliance with all applicable inspection and registration requirements, including any required safety inspections. You will only list vehicles with a clean, non-salvaged, non-written off, non-washed, and non-branded title. You agree to respond to any applicable recall or similar safety notices and to complete any recommended action before allowing your vehicle to be booked. In addition, if Rentos believes that your vehicle does not conform to reasonable standards, Rentos may notify you and reserves the right to remove or decline listing your vehicle until its concerns have been resolved. Rentos may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles booked through the Services.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Insurance and protection plans</span> 

Rentos is not an insurance company and does not insure hosts or guests. Host and guest protection plans made available through the Services are in no way related. To be eligible for the benefits of a protection plan, hosts and guests must comply with these Terms.


<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Hosting tools and teams</span> 
 

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Obligations of hosts and Co-hosts</span> 
 
You are responsible for your own acts or failures to act. To the maximum extent possible under applicable law, you are responsible for the acts and failures when providing your services on Rentos. You are responsible for complying with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the hosting services. These may require you to obtain a permit or license before providing services. In no cases are hosts employees of Rentos. You represent and warrant that you and those who work with you have all necessary permits, licenses, and/or insurance required.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Relationship of hosts and Rentos</span> 
 
Any agreement between a host and Rentos does not create an employment, agency, or other service relationship between Rentos and any host. A host cannot create an agreement that conflicts with the Agreement or expands Rentos' obligations or restricts Rentos' rights under the Agreement. Rentos has no control over your conduct and is not obligated to mediate disputes between hosts. Any liability arising from or related to any agreement or dispute between hosts and is disclaimed by Rentos to the maximum extent permitted by law.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Reporting vehicle damage</span> 
 
If you did not decline a protection plan made available via the Services, and you believe that a guest has caused any damage to your vehicle, you are required to report that damage as soon as you become aware of it (and in any event, no more than 24 hours after the scheduled end of the trip) and to provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation of the damage so that it can be eligible for coverage. Based on the investigation, Rentos or third-party claims administrators will reasonably determine whether the damage occurred during the reservation period and is eligible for coverage. If it was, and you did not decline a protection plan made available via the Services, you will be reimbursed for the loss as described in the sections below. If Rentos is not given prompt notice as described in this paragraph, or if you do not provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation by Rentos or third-party claims administrators, we may not be able to determine the cause. In that case, you agree that we may decline any reimbursement or coverage for such damage.


<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Physical damage to your vehicle</span> 

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Physical damage reimbursement</span> 

The protection plans available to hosts address the allocation of financial consequences of physical damage to the vehicle offered by a host during a trip. Physical damage contractual reimbursement from Rentos applies to your vehicle in the event of a collision and comprehensive events during the trip, and is subject to terms and exclusions.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Exclusions to physical damage reimbursement and coverage</span> 
Protection plans selected by hosts on the Services do not apply to:
- Optional extras or personal property, including aftermarket installations (e.g., equipment racks), that are taken from your vehicle or damaged during a trip. Remove all personal property before making your vehicle available for a reservation.
- Normal wear and tear to your vehicle.
- If you violate the Agreement, these Terms, or any of our Policies or if you submit inaccurate information about your vehicle when listing it on the Services (for example, falsely represent the make, model, or year of the vehicle), any protection plan you selected will be voided. A protection plan will be voided under this provision even if the underlying circumstances are not directly related to the damage or harm at issue. You acknowledge that these provisions are material and that they serve to ensure your compliance. In the event your protection plan is voided, the remainder of the Agreement, these Terms, and Policies remain in effect.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Other host-specific insurance matters</span> 
You will maintain valid and up-to-date registration information and proof of insurance in any vehicle you share on the Services. You must maintain your own auto insurance policy for any vehicle you list on the Services, and such policy must meet any minimum insurance levels required by law. You may need additional insurance coverage, including physical damage coverage, if you share a vehicle subject to a lease or loan. You agree to provide Rentos with information regarding your auto insurance policy as may be requested and to keep such information up to date. Where not prohibited by law, you hereby appoint Rentos or a wholly owned subsidiary of Rentos as your attorney-in-fact for the purpose of filing insurance claims, receiving insurance payment, otherwise administering an applicable insurance policy, and/or working with law enforcement, guests, or private entities to recover your vehicle, as necessary.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Missing vehicles</span> 
If you selected a protection plan via the Services and your vehicle goes missing, is not returned, and/or is stolen during the reservation period (or extension period), you, as the host, must immediately contact a Rentos representative and follow his or her instructions, including cooperating with Rentos, the police, and any other authorities in all matters related to the investigation of the theft. If you are instructed by Rentos to file a police report, you must do so within 24 hours of receiving those instructions.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Indemnification of host</span>  
If you selected a protection plan via the Services, in the event of any claim for a loss or injury that occurs during the use of your vehicle by a guest (or by Rentos itself), subject to your compliance with these Terms and the Policies, Rentos or its insurers will defend and indemnify you, subject to any exclusions or limitations in the policy or policies of insurance contained with the protection plan, against such claims as required by applicable law. In connection with any indemnified claim, you are required to give Rentos or its insurers prompt written notice of the claim, allow Rentos sole control over the defense of the claim, and provide Rentos reasonable cooperation in its defense of the claim, at Rentos' expense. If Rentos or its insurers reimburse you for a lost or damaged vehicle and you later receive payment for some or all of your vehicle from a third party (e.g., a third-party insurance company or restitution), you must reimburse Rentos any monies received from that third party in an amount equivalent to, but not to exceed, the funds provided to you by Rentos.


<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Resolution of Disputes</span>   Dispute Resolution

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;"> Dispute Resolution for Hosts and Guests</span>  

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION AND THEREFORE AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW CLAIMS YOU AND RENTOS HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.**

Subject to applicable law, the Parties agree that any disputes or claims between us relating in any way to, or arising out of, this or previous versions of these Terms, your use of or access to the Services, or any breach, enforcement, or termination of the Agreement will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Dispute resolution for hosts and guests.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</span>   

Should a dispute or claim arise between us, you and Rentos agree to notify the other Party of the nature of the dispute or claim prior to initiating arbitration, and the Parties will attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact us by email at insert email here. Please provide your name, phone number, email, mailing address, and briefly describe both the nature of your dispute and the relief you would like from Rentos. If the Parties are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, then the Party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other Party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed as appropriate. Any settlement offer made by you or Rentos shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Agreement to Arbitrate</span>   

The Parties each agree that any and all disputes, claims, or controversies that have arisen or may arise at any time between you and Rentos (including its respective subsidiaries, employees, officers, directors, agents, third-party insurance brokers or products, and third-party claims administrators) and/or any other Rentos user will be resolved by binding arbitration according to the procedure set forth below. For the purpose of this Agreement to Arbitrate, “disputes," "claims,” and "controversies" shall have the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, any and all disputes and/or claims that arise out of or in any way relate to your relationship with Rentos, including but not limited to: 
1. your use of the Services, 
2. the Agreement, these Terms and/or this Agreement to Arbitrate, including the interpretation, validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or 
3. your use of, or access to the Services, and anything sold, offered, or purchased through the Services (such as booking, listing, or sharing a vehicle). 

Through this Agreement to Arbitrate, and subject to the below exceptions, the Parties intend to arbitrate all disputes or claims regardless of whether they are based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory and regardless of whether they arose or accrued before the Parties entered into this Agreement to Arbitrate. For avoidance of doubt, the Parties expressly agree that this Agreement to Arbitrate encompasses all disputes or claims pertaining to the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement to Arbitrate and any such disputes or claims will be referred to binding arbitration and will be resolved by the arbitrator and not a court as per the Lebanese Arbitration and Mediation Center (LAMC) Arbitration Rules.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</span>   

The only exceptions to this Agreement to Arbitrate are as follows:
- **Disputes or claims that can be brought in small claims court**
- **Injunctive or equitable relief** to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a Party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. However, the Parties agree that any court proceedings shall be stayed pending the final resolution in arbitration of any arbitrable claims or issues
- **Any cause of action or claim for relief** which cannot be arbitrated as a matter of applicable statute or public policy. However, the Parties agree that any such court proceedings shall be stayed pending the final resolution in arbitration of any arbitrable claims or issues

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Arbitration Procedures</span>   

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.

In all cases in which a live hearing is requested or required, you and/or Rentos may attend by video or phone. To the extent a location must be established for the arbitration, it shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Rentos user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Where permitted, the Parties agree that all communications, evidence, and rulings in the arbitration will remain confidential, except as reasonably necessary to enforce or implement such rulings or this Agreement to Arbitrate.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Costs of Arbitration</span>   

If you initiate arbitration proceedings, you will be responsible for certain costs. Where the relief sought is $50,000 or less (not including attorney and administrative fees and expenses), you will be responsible for the initial filing fee, capped at $1,000, and Rentos will cover any additional fees or costs. Where the relief sought is $50,001 or more (not including attorney and administrative fees and expenses), you and Rentos will each pay your own arbitration fees consistent with the rules set by the LAMC at the time the claim was made, unless otherwise stated in these Terms.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Severability</span>   

With the exception of the provisions in the below section **“Prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief,”** if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in the section **“Prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief”** is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement, these Terms, and dispute resolution section will continue to apply.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration; Procedure</span>   

**IF YOU ARE A NEW TURO USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO OPT-OUT OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE** BY EMAILING US AN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS FOR THE FIRST TIME OR BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF YOUR FIRST TRIP ON TURO AS A GUEST OR HOST, WHICHEVER DATE IS EARLIEST. In order to opt-out, you must email your full name, address (including street address, city, state, and zip/postal code), and email address(es) associated with your Rentos Account. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other provisions of the Agreement will continue to apply to you, including the below forum selection clause.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate</span>   

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, the Parties agree that if Rentos makes any amendment to the Agreement to Arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that you filed against Rentos prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between the Parties. If you do not agree to the amended terms, you may close your account within 30 days of our posting or notification and you will not be bound by the amended terms; provided that the Parties will arbitrate any dispute in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement to Arbitrate as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms). Once you have submitted a valid Opt-Out Notice to Rentos, you do NOT need to submit another one when these Terms are subsequently updated. Your first Opt-Out Notice will serve as a valid as to future versions of these Terms.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration</span>   

Unless the Parties agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, whether (1) as a result of your decision to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, (2) as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, or (3) if one of the above exceptions to the Agreement to Arbitrate applies, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between the Parties will be resolved exclusively by a state, federal, or small claims court.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</span>   

**THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN COURT OR ARBITRATION.** UNLESS THE PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE COURT OR ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE COURT OR ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS, SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE EXCEPTION ALLOWING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO BE SOUGHT IN COURT BUT ONLY IF THAT EXCEPTION IS FOUND TO APPLY.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Dispute Resolution for Hosts and Guests Residing Outside Lebanon</span>   

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS THE PARTIES HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.** Regardless of where you reside, if you bring an action against Rentos in Lebanon, the section above entitled **“Dispute resolution for hosts and guests”** will govern that dispute.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Resolution of Disputes</span>   

If a dispute arises between the Parties, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. We encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution.. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation under the LAMC and laws of Lebanon. The laws of Lebanon shall govern these Terms and the Agreement and any dispute or claim you have against Rentos.


<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;"> General Provisions</span>  

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Termination</span>    
You may discontinue your use of the Services at any time and Rentos may terminate your access to the Services and remove any listings for any reason or no reason to the extent permissible under applicable law. Termination of access to the Services will not release a Party from any obligations it incurred prior to the termination and Rentos may retain and continue to use any information, including but not limited to photography, previously provided by you. Termination of the Agreement will not have any effect on the disclaimers, waiver or liability limitations, or legal disputes provisions under the Agreement and/or any fees due, and all of those terms will survive any termination of the Agreement.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">No Vehicle Transfer or Assignment</span>    
Except as otherwise provided herein, guests and hosts agree that nothing in these Terms constitutes an actual or purported transfer or assignment of any right or interest in a vehicle or optional Extras shared through the Services.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Disclaimers</span>    
**RENTOS PROVIDES SERVICES THAT ENABLE THE SHARING OF VEHICLES AND OPTIONAL EXTRAS BETWEEN HOSTS AND GUESTS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, RENTOS DOES NOT ITSELF PROVIDE VEHICLE SHARING, RENTAL SERVICES, AND/OR INSURANCE SERVICES AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY OF THE USERS OF ITS SERVICES, THE MANUFACTURER OF THE VEHICLE OR ANY OPTIONAL EXTRAS, OR ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER OF SERVICES (E.G. IN-VEHICLE GPS OR OTHER SYSTEMS).**  
The Services are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. To the extent permitted by applicable law, without limiting the foregoing, Rentos explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. Rentos makes no warranty that the Services, including, but not limited to, the listing and/or any vehicle or optional Extra, will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. Rentos makes no warranty regarding the quality of any listings, vehicles, hosts, guests, Extras, the Services, or any content or the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any content obtained through the Services. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Rentos, or any of its service providers or through the Services or content, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Limitation of Liability and Waiver</span>    
**EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WAIVE AND DISCHARGE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS YOU HAVE TO SUE OR MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST RENTOS AND ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS (INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATORS, INSURANCE PRODUCERS, AND INSURANCE PROVIDERS), OR EMPLOYEES (TOGETHER, THE “RENTOS PARTIES”) AND ANY RENTOS USER FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES, WHETHER DUE TO NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOLLOWING:**  
1. Vehicle availability (e.g., a vehicle not being available or returned when it was supposed to be).  
2. Problems with a vehicle (e.g., any malfunction of or deficiency with a vehicle).  
3. Vehicle warranty issues (e.g., any breach of warranty or other obligation by any manufacturer or other third party associated with the vehicle).  
4. The legal or license status of a vehicle, host, or guest.  
5. Third-party assessments of a vehicle's value.  
6. Any action or inaction of a host or guest.  

**YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RENTOS NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES** (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES), WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTION WITH THE FOLLOWING:  
1. The Agreement,  
2. The Services (including listing or booking of any vehicle or optional Extra via the Services), or  
3. Inability to use the Services.  

Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable hosts or guests pursuant to these Terms, including an approved payment request or claim under a protection plan or applicable insurance policy, in no event will the Rentos Parties' aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Agreement or your use of the Services, exceed the greater of:  
1. The amounts you have paid or owe for bookings via the Services as a guest in the twelve-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are a host, the amount earned by you in the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or  
2. US$100.  

**EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU ALSO WAIVE AND DISCHARGE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS YOU HAVE TO SUE OR MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST ANY RENTOS USER FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.**

**YOU WAIVE CIVIL CODE, OR ANY SIMILAR LAW, WHICH STATES:**  
“A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

The above limitations of liability and waiver provisions are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Rentos and you. They shall apply to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any aspects of them that are deemed void or unenforceable shall be severed while leaving the remainder in effect.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Indemnification</span>    
You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Rentos and its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with:  
1. Your access to or use of the Services,  
2. Your violation of these Terms,  
3. Your user content,  
4. Your interaction with any other user of the Services, or  
5. Your booking of a vehicle or creation of a listing for a vehicle.  

Such indemnification includes but is not limited to any injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential, or otherwise) arising in connection with or as a result of a booking, sharing, or use of a vehicle or optional Extra. This indemnification provision is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between Rentos and you. It shall apply to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any aspects of it that are deemed unenforceable shall be severed while leaving the remainder in effect.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Liquidated Damages</span>    
You acknowledge that the actual damages likely to result from your breaches of the Agreement by any of the following are difficult to estimate accurately and would be difficult for Rentos to prove with certainty:  
1. Engaging in gray market transactions, as defined in these Terms,  
2. Using the Rentos domains, trademarks, or taglines without Rentos' express consent, including without limitation registering website domains or social media handles, or bidding on online advertising keywords,  
3. Suing or asserting legal claims against the Rentos Parties or a Rentos user in any manner prohibited or waived herein,  
4. As a host, sharing your vehicle via the Services with expired registration stickers or without current registration paperwork in the vehicle,  
5. As a host, offering any vehicle that is the subject of a missing or stolen vehicle report,  
6. As a host, offering any vehicle or releasing a vehicle to a guest that is not roadworthy or is otherwise in an unsafe condition,  
7. As a host, cancel or modify a trip to manipulate the price or potential earnings for a vehicle, or  
8. Creating or using a Rentos account that has the effect of circumventing Rentos' suspension, termination, or closure of another Rentos account.  

**You will pay Rentos $5,500 per breach in Liquidated Damages** to compensate Rentos for any such conduct. This amount is not intended as a punishment for any such breach, but rather as a reasonable estimate where actual damages are difficult to estimate accurately and/or prove with certainty. This liquidated damages provision is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between Rentos and you. It shall apply to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any aspects of it that are deemed unenforceable shall be severed while leaving the remainder in effect.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Not a Rental Car Company; No Vehicle Leasing</span>    
Rentos is not a rental car company. It does not own a fleet of vehicles and is not in the business of renting vehicles to the public. Rentos also is not providing short- or long-term vehicle leases. Rentos provides an online platform where vehicle owners and those in need of a vehicle can meet and share vehicles amongst themselves subject to these Terms.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Rounding off; Currency</span>    
Rentos may, in its sole discretion, round up or down amounts that are payable from or to hosts or guests to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro, pound, or other supported currency) unless explicitly prohibited under applicable law. The currency displayed on the Services is based on the search location, vehicle location, and/or host location.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Translations</span>    
Where Rentos has provided you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms or any Policies, in case of any wording discrepancies between the English and any other versions of the Terms and any Policies, the English language wording takes precedence. In France and if you are a consumer, the French language version will prevail.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">Severability and Non-Waiver</span>    
In the event any provision of these Terms is held to be void, voidable, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of any Party to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, or any other provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of these Terms or any part of these Terms, or any right of any Party to enforce that provision or each and every other provision at any time. No waiver of any breach of these Terms shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any other breach.

<span style="font-size: 30px; color: black;">General</span>    
Rentos does not appoint you or any other user as its employee, mandatory, legal agent, or form any kind of legal partnership or joint venture. You are not authorized to make any commitments on behalf of Rentos and Rentos will not make commitments on your behalf, except as contemplated by the Services or expressly stated in these Terms.  
The Agreement, including these Terms, states the entire understanding between you and Rentos concerning your access to and use of the Services and supersedes any earlier verbal or written communications between us. With the exception of appointing a custodian to manage your vehicles on your behalf, you may not delegate your legal obligations or transfer any of your rights, in whole or in part, to any third party without advance written consent of Rentos. You will remain responsible for your obligations hereunder in any event. A Rentos director or officer must agree to any modification or waiver of any term of the Agreement in writing. Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section.
