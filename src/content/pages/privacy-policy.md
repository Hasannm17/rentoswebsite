**Rentos** and its subsidiaries (collectively, “**Rentos**”, “we”, or “us”) care about privacy and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use, process, and disclose your personal information. This **Privacy Policy** describes our privacy practices in connection with our websites and applications that link to this **Privacy Policy** (collectively, the “Services”) and our offline interactions with you in settings where we post this **Privacy Policy**.  

We collect three categories of personal information:  
1. **Personal information you give us**  
2. **Personal information automatically collected from your use of the Services**  
3. **Personal information from third-party sources**  

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Personal information you give us</span>
  

- **Account data**. When you register for an account with us, we require certain personal information to open your account, such as your name, email address, password, and address.  

- **Profile data**. We may also ask you to provide additional profile information to use certain features of the Services which may include addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license number, date of issuance and issuing country, profile photos, and date of birth. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile photos, full name, etc.) are part of your public profile page and will be publicly visible to others.  

- **Vehicle data**. We collect information you provide in relation to a vehicle such as vehicle listing details, vehicle identification number (VIN), vehicle location, availability dates, reviews, and uploaded vehicle and documentation photos.  

- **Payment data**. We collect your digital payment details, bank account or payment card numbers, and transaction information in connection with a potential or actual transaction, which may be processed and stored by one or more third-party payment service providers or digital payments companies.  

- **Identity verification data**. In some instances, we may collect identity verification information such as a photograph or scanned copy of a driver’s license, passport, national ID card, or payment card, social media account information, driver’s/motor vehicle record, car insurance information, or other forms of identification information. Where we request that you withhold certain information (such as obscuring or redacting aspects of identification information), please do so.  

- **Biometric data**. In some instances and with your consent, we or our third-party provider(s) may collect biometric information such as facial recognition data derived from photos and identification documents you submit for verification.  

- **Communications**. When you communicate with **Rentos**, including via phone, WhatsApp, email, or chat, or use the Services to communicate with other users, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.


<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">How We Use Your Personal Information</span>
  
We use, store, and process your personal information to provide and improve the Services and for security and safety purposes. For example, we may use your information:

We may use your personal information to analyze and improve the Services and to develop new products and services, including by studying our user demographics of the Services. We may also create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data from your personal information. We make personal information into anonymous data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Services and promote our business.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">For marketing and advertising:</span>
 
We and our third-party advertising partners may collect and use your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes:

- **Interest-based advertising**. We may contract with third-party advertising and social media companies to display ads on the Services and other sites. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about you (including device data, online activity data, and/or geolocation data described above) over time across our Services and other sites and services or your interaction with our emails, and use that information to serve ads that they think will interest you. These ads are known as “interest-based advertisements”. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising in the Interest-based advertising choices section below.

We use your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal processes, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">With your consent:</span>
 
In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to process your personal information.  
We may also use your personal information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.


<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">How We Disclose Your Personal Information</span>
  

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">With your consent</span>
 
We may share your information at your direction or with your consent.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Profiles, listings, and other public information</span>
 
Your public listing page on the Services will always include some basic information, such as:  
- Your user ID or name associated with your account  
- Your public profile photo  
- For hosts, the city where your car is located  
- Your listing description  
- Your calendar availability  
- Transaction-related information to allow our community to evaluate your reliability and responsiveness  
- Reviews or feedback about you  

Your public listing page may also include aggregate demand information (such as number of page views over a period of time) and information about your cancellations. The Services may also display the approximate geographic pick-up location of your vehicle.  

The Services allow your public profile and public listing pages to be included in search engines, in which case your public profile and public listing pages may be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Sharing between hosts and guests</span>
 
Rentos enables car owners and those authorized to offer and share vehicles with other individuals. If you agree to a booking through the Services, we may provide your information to the other party in that transaction as reasonably necessary to facilitate the transaction. For example:  
- Rentos may provide your **mobile phone number** to facilitate communication  
- Rentos may provide your **driver's license information** to confirm license validity and for identity verification  
- Rentos may provide your **photograph** to facilitate identification  

We will also share the **address of the vehicle** and, if applicable, the proposed **delivery location** with the other party. The other party may also send you **text messages** (such as to confirm pickup or delivery location). Standard telephone minute, text, and data charges may apply.

 <span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Service Providers</span>
  

We may share information with vendors and service providers who support the operation of the Services and business and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us (including, for example, web hosting, analytics, payment processing, email delivery, marketing, insurance, claims administration, vehicle recovery, roadside assistance, incident response, and customer support services).  

In some cases, the service provider may directly collect the information from you on our behalf. For hosts who choose to use our photography program, your contact information will be shared with the photographer assigned to shoot your vehicle. These service providers may use your personal information only as directed or authorized by us.  

If you consent to SMS communications, we will not disclose your opt-in preference to third parties for SMS purposes, except as necessary to provide the Services and/or to facilitate the communication you have consented to.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Third-party platforms and social media networks</span>
  
If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network (such as by logging in to the Services using your account with the third party, providing your API key or similar access token for the Services to a third party, or otherwise linking your Services account to a third party’s services), we may disclose to the third-party platform or social media network the personal information necessary to facilitate the connection or that you authorized us to share.  

We do not control the third party’s use of your personal information.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Professional advisors</span>

We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Business transfers</span>

We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your personal information, in connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Responding to legal requests, preventing harm, and protecting our rights</span>

We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or tax authorities, or third parties. We will make such disclosure to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by applicable law or where we consider such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:  
- **Comply with our legal obligations or legal process**  
- **Respond to claims asserted against us**  
- **For security and safety purposes** described above  

We may also disclose your information in response to valid legal requests relating to criminal investigations or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose Rentos, you, or any other user, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Rentos, our users, or others.

We may also disclose your personal information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Your Preferences and Choices</span>
  

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Communication preferences</span>

You can control the methods by which we may contact you about your account, your booking and listing activities, promotions, and announcements.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Opting out of marketing communications</span>

You may opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.  

If you receive marketing text messages from us, you may opt out of receiving further marketing text messages from us by replying **STOP** to our marketing message or as described in the message.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Correct and update</span>
 
You can review, correct, update, and edit certain information that has been previously provided to us by you at any time by logging in to your account and reviewing your account settings and profile. You can also access or request a correction of your information by contacting us.  

For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Account closure</span>
 
If you wish to close your account and request deletion of your personal information, please send us an email or directly contact our support team on the website.  

Please note that we may be unable to delete information needed to comply with applicable laws, detect or prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, assist with or process claims, troubleshoot problems, assist with any audits and investigations, enforce our Terms of Service and Policies, and take other actions reasonably necessary, permitted, or required by applicable law. There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Access</span>
 
You can request a copy of your personal information pursuant to any information access rights that you may have under applicable laws in your account page or by contacting us.

Users of our mobile application can disable the application’s access to the device’s location within the device’s settings.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Interest-based advertising choices</span>
  
Your choices for limiting use of your personal information for interest-based advertising include:

- **Cookie preferences**: You may change your cookie preferences for Rentos' website at any time via the cookie preferences link located in the webpage footer.
  
- **Blocking cookies in your browser**: Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org).

- **Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings**: Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device (e.g., Apple ID for Advertising or Google Advertising ID) for interest-based advertising purposes.

- **Using privacy plug-ins or browsers**: You can block sites from setting cookies for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy features, like **Brave**, or installing browser plugins like **Privacy Badger**, **Ghostery**, or **uBlock Origin**, and configuring them to block third-party cookies/trackers.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Choosing not to share your personal information</span>
  
Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the Services to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or we later delete it at your request), we may not be able to provide you with the Services.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Third-party platforms and social media networks</span>
  
If you choose to connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network, such as by using the third party’s authentication service to log into your account on the Services, you may be able to control your settings through the third-party platform or social media network.  

If you withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.


<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Security</span>
  
We employ a number of technical, physical, and organizational measures designed to protect information against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration while it is under our control. However, no method of transmitting or storing information can be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;"> Other Important Information</span>
 

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Cross-border transfer</span>
  
The Services are controlled and operated from Lebanon. Your personal information may be used, stored, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. These locations may be outside of your state, province, or country of residence, and may have different and/or less protective data protection rules than those of your state, province, or country. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, regulatory agencies, security authorities, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to the laws in those jurisdictions.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Sensitive information</span>
  
We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive information (e.g., Social Security numbers, social insurance numbers, passports, information related to racial or ethnic origin, or health) on or through the Services or otherwise to us unless specifically requested.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Minors</span>
  
The Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from users under the age of 18. If a minor under the age of 18 has already provided us with personal information, his or her parent or guardian may contact us to request that we delete it.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Third-party privacy practices</span>
  
This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information collected by Rentos. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third-party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply. Some areas of the Services implement Google Maps/Places mapping services, including the Google Places API. Your use of the Services is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Translations</span>
  
Where Rentos has provided you with a version of this Privacy Policy in a language other than English, in case of any wording discrepancies between such version and the English version, the English wording takes precedence.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span>
  
We may change this Privacy Policy. Please take a look at the “Last revised” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services or as otherwise indicated. Your use of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these changes, you can contact us to close your account.

<span style="font-size: 33px; color: black;">Contact</span>
  
Rentos welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please feel free to contact us via email or through the website.
